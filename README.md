# aws-inspector-rules-pkgs
AWS CloudFormation mapping template for AWS Inspector rules packages

This repository contains an AWS Cloudformation napping template for the AWS Insepctor rule packages that are available as of the time of this writing.  You can find the text version of this here:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_rules-arns.html

I converted the file into YAML. I encourage you to validate the contents of the file "AWS Inspector Rules Pkgs.yaml" to determine if the file contains the appropriate entries.
